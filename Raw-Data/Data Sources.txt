Homeownership analysis
Data from IPUMS-USA available through the IPUMS API. Access to IPUMS-USA requires creating an account and agreeing to their user agreement. They also place restrictions on publicly disseminating their data; therefore, replication of this analysis requires accessing data either through the IPUMS API (the method implemented in my scripts) or directly through the IPUMS-USA extract system. If the latter method is used, the user can ignore certain sections in 01_wrangling.do and edit the script to directly access their own IPUMS-USA extract.
